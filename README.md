# OpenSavvy Notes: Kotlin Fullstack CLI

This repository contains a backend and a frontend implementations of the [OpenSavvy Notes specification](specs/README.md), written entirely in Kotlin.

The core layer (entity representation, validation, concurrency, caching, API DTOsâ€¦) is shared between the backend and frontend.
The frontend is a simple CLI. Other more complex UIs will be provided by separate projects. Don't hesitate to contribute one!
